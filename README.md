# CapTech_Fitness-wellness_map
This project is my submission for Capitol Tech Hackathon 2022, this is an interactive map of the university which contains events, and activities held on campus to help students fitness and mental wellness.

## Purpose

The prupose of this application is to follow the theme which is to endorse fitness and mental wellness. Now the question is how can I do that with this application. I noticed that in Capitol Technology University, some students are not aware of the different activities that allow students to not only be physically fit but also be mentally well in their own way. To demonstrate this, I wanted to create an interactive map of the campus which includes the different activities and facilities I believe truly help students be physcially fit but also be mentally well. I made this map under the idea of providing this to other students so they are aware of these activities and facilities since from my experinece they have helped me alot to be mentally and physcially well, and I believe this type of application not only fits my criteria for making one but also fits with the theme of endorsing fitness and mental wellness.

## Resources utilized

Priot to making this project, I was essentially new to making an application that utilizes a map. I have never worked with maps nor really had to make an interactive map before. So while digging into the subject I found about the [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/index.html) library which allowed me to create a basic map of the campus, and while playing around with it, I was able to do what i seeked to do thanks to the [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0) also allowing the process to get the longitude and latitude values far easier.
